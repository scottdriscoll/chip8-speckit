# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Capture emulator expectations: ROM types, timing accuracy, input/audio experience

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Supported ROM formats and known test suites
   - Display resolution, color treatment, and scaling behavior  
   - Input mapping (keyboard, touch, gamepad) and remapping rules
   - Audio expectations (on/off toggle, latency tolerance)
   - Performance targets (60 fps, 60 Hz timers) and fallback plans
   - Save-state/storage requirements (local storage, cloud sync)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Emulator MUST load CHIP-8 ROMs from local upload and curated library sources.
- **FR-002**: Emulator MUST render the 64√ó32 display (and Super-CHIP variants when relevant) with configurable scaling in-browser.
- **FR-003**: Emulator MUST enforce 60 Hz timers and deterministic execution across runs given identical input sequences.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to configure keypad/input mappings for keyboard, touch, or gamepad.
- **FR-005**: Emulator MUST surface performance and observability data (frame time, opcode throughput, audio status) per Principle V.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: Emulator MUST generate audio using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: WebAudio beep behavior not specified - duration, frequency?]
- **FR-007**: Emulator MUST persist save-states to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage target not specified - IndexedDB, file download?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **EmulatorState**: Registers (V0‚ÄìVF), I register, program counter, stack, delay/sound timers.
- **DisplayBuffer**: 64√ó32 (or Super-CHIP resolution) pixel state, scaling attributes, collision flags.
