# Speckit Chip-8 Emulator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Instruction-Accurate Emulation
- MUST implement the complete CHIP-8 instruction set according to authoritative references; any deviation requires documented justification before merge.
- MUST keep emulator execution deterministic: the same ROM and input sequence MUST always reproduce identical frames, timers, and memory state.
- MUST block releases on failing conformance ROMs or opcode regression tests.
- Rationale: Fidelity preserves user trust in the emulator and prevents downstream debugging churn.

### II. Single C# Core, WebAssembly Delivery
- MUST maintain a single C# codebase that compiles to WebAssembly for browser delivery; platform-specific plumbing stays in thin adapters.
- MUST express browser interactions (canvas, audio, input, persistence) through typed interfaces so they can be mocked in tests and reused for future hosts.
- MUST avoid introducing alternative language runtimes unless the constitution is amended.
- Rationale: A unified C# core simplifies maintenance, testing, and reuse across WebAssembly targets.

### III. Test-First Coverage of Every Opcode and Device Contract
- MUST write failing unit or integration tests for each opcode, timer behavior, and I/O pathway before implementation changes land.
- MUST keep a living catalog of reference ROMs with automated CI execution; adding a ROM pairs with a regression test.
- MUST capture bug fixes by first reproducing the fault in tests to prevent silent regressions.
- Rationale: Test-first discipline prevents subtle emulation drift and anchors future refactors.

### IV. Deterministic Timing & Input Discipline
- MUST schedule instruction execution in whole emulator cycles tied to CHIP-8’s 60 Hz timer semantics, independent of browser frame jitter.
- MUST centralize keyboard/input mapping so key bindings stay consistent across platforms and are fully remappable.
- MUST expose timing and input hooks for tooling (e.g., frame stepping, pause/resume) without compromising determinism.
- Rationale: Stable timing and input handling enable accurate gameplay and reproducible debugging sessions.

### V. Performance & Observability in the Browser
- MUST sustain a minimum of 60 rendered frames per second on reference hardware while keeping CPU usage within agreed budgets (<50% of a single browser thread).
- MUST provide lightweight instrumentation (frame time, opcode throughput, audio buffer health) surfaced via the Web UI and logs for diagnostics.
- MUST default to efficient memory usage: no unbounded allocations per frame, and a documented upper bound on emulator state size.
- Rationale: Responsive, observable WebAssembly delivery ensures the emulator remains enjoyable and supportable.

## Architecture Constraints

- The core emulator lives in a portable C# project targeting the latest long-term support .NET runtime capable of WebAssembly export.
- Rendering, audio, and persistence adapters MUST interact with the core through explicit interfaces under `src/Platform/` (or equivalent) to preserve testability.
- Browser presentation uses WebAssembly (e.g., via Blazor WebAssembly or Uno); any additional frontend tooling MUST justify compliance with Principle II before adoption.
- ROM loading, save-state, and configuration flows MUST remain asynchronous and non-blocking to keep the UI responsive.

## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates

- Every change proposal includes a Constitution Check section in plan/spec/tasks outputs referencing the governing principles it touches.
- CI MUST run unit, integration, and ROM conformance suites in headless WebAssembly mode before merge; red builds block releases.
- Code review requires at least two maintainers or one maintainer plus automated gating that affirms constitutional compliance.
- Releases MUST document performance benchmarks, browser compatibility results, and any principle deviations with remediation plans.

## Governance

- Amendments require an RFC referencing affected principles, sign-off from two maintainers, and an updated Sync Impact Report.
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for principle removals or rewrites, MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications.
- Ratified principles apply to all contributors; exceptions demand explicit temporary waivers recorded in the RFC log and sunset dates.
- Compliance reviews occur each release cycle and during any platform shift (e.g., new browser runtime) to confirm adherence.
