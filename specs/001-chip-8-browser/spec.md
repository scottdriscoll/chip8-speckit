# Feature Specification: Chip-8 Browser Emulator HUD & Controls

**Feature Branch**: `[001-chip-8-browser]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Chip-8 emulator running in the browser with full keyboard and sound support plus real-time register/timer/instruction display"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: emulator platform, user interactions, observability needs, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Ensure scenarios cover gameplay, instrumentation visibility, accessibility
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Flag remaining ambiguities
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Capture emulator expectations: ROM types, timing accuracy, input/audio experience

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Supported ROM formats and known test suites
   - Display resolution, color treatment, and scaling behavior  
   - Input mapping (keyboard, touch, gamepad) and remapping rules
   - Audio expectations (on/off toggle, latency tolerance)
   - Performance targets (60 fps, 60 Hz timers) and fallback plans
   - Save-state/storage requirements (local storage, cloud sync)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A retro gaming enthusiast visits the web-based Chip-8 emulator, loads a favorite ROM, and plays using a keyboard while observing live register, timer, and instruction data in side panels without the play window being obstructed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the player has loaded a ROM, **When** they press mapped keyboard keys during gameplay, **Then** the on-screen keypad highlights, the ROM responds correctly, and live status panes update registers, timers, and current instruction on each cycle.
2. **Given** the player enables sound while a ROM emits beeps, **When** the sound timer fires, **Then** a simple Chip-8-style beep plays in sync with the instrumentation view showing the sound timer countdown.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the browser denies audio autoplay or the user has muted the tab?
- How does the system handle keyboards missing certain Chip-8 keycodes (e.g., mobile or compact layouts)?
- How is the UI affected when the ROM executes instructions faster than the display refresh (e.g., turbo mode or performance spikes)?
- What guidance do we provide when a user‚Äôs keyboard lacks keys for the preferred Chip-8 layout (e.g., laptop function rows)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Emulator MUST allow users to load standard Chip-8 ROMs from local files and from a curated sample list aligned with conformance testing.
- **FR-002**: Emulator MUST render gameplay within a primary viewport at 60 frames per second with deterministic 60 Hz timers, maintaining responsiveness across supported browsers.
- **FR-003**: Emulator MUST provide full keyboard input coverage for all Chip-8 keys using a layout comfortable for the original hex keypad (e.g., `1234`/`QWER` rows) and display visual mapping feedback.
- **FR-004**: Emulator MUST deliver audible feedback for sound timer events using a simple Chip-8-style beep, including user controls to mute/unmute and basic volume indication.
- **FR-005**: Emulator MUST display real-time register values (V0‚ÄìVF, I, PC, stack depth), delay and sound timers, and current opcode/instruction in dedicated frames surrounding the main viewport without obscuring gameplay.
- **FR-006**: Emulator MUST update the instrumentation panels synchronously with the emulation cycle so that the displayed instruction corresponds to the frame being rendered.
- **FR-007**: Emulator MUST provide pause/resume and single-step controls that freeze gameplay while keeping instrumentation visible for inspection.
- **FR-008**: Emulator MUST expose an error state when ROM loading fails, detailing the issue while leaving previous instrumentation intact for troubleshooting.

*Ambiguities requiring follow-up*
- None.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **EmulatorState**: Captures registers, memory pointers, stack, current opcode, timers, and execution flags required for display and control tooling.
- **InstrumentationPanel**: Represents the structured data shown in side frames, including refresh cadence and visibility toggles for each metric group.
- **KeyboardLayout**: Captures the chosen Chip-8-friendly key mapping, visual labels, and any optional user overrides.
