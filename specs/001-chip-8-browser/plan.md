# Implementation Plan: Chip-8 Browser Emulator HUD & Controls

**Branch**: `001-chip-8-browser` | **Date**: 2025-09-25 | **Spec**: [`specs/001-chip-8-browser/spec.md`](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-chip-8-browser/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Deliver a browser-hosted Chip-8 emulator experience with full keyboard input, timer-driven beep audio, and real-time HUD panels that display registers, timers, and the current opcode without obscuring gameplay. Implementation keeps all logic in the existing .NET 8 WebAssembly core, adds Web UI components for instrumentation, and safeguards 60 fps performance through deterministic timing and telemetry checks.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C# (.NET 8 WebAssembly)  
**Primary Dependencies**: .NET WebAssembly workload, HTML Canvas (with WebGL fallback) for display, JS interop for WebAudio beep, Playwright for browser automation  
**Storage**: In-memory emulator state only (no persistence)  
**Testing**: xUnit for opcode/state coverage, Playwright WASM harness for HUD verification, ROM conformance suite runner  
**Target Platform**: Browser (WebAssembly)
**Project Type**: Single C# core with Web adapters  
**Performance Goals**: Sustain 60 fps render loop and deterministic 60 Hz timers (adjust if feature-specific)  
**Constraints**: Deterministic execution, bounded memory (<1 MB state), no alternate runtimes unless amended  
**Scale/Scope**: Single ROM execution per session with HUD covering 16 registers, timers, stack depth, and keypad highlights

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle I – Instruction-Accurate Emulation**: Core emulator behavior remains untouched; HUD reads from snapshots and regression tests cover timer/opcode visibility → PASS.
- **Principle II – Single C# Core, WebAssembly Delivery**: All logic stays in the C# WebAssembly project with minimal JS interop for audio playback → PASS.
- **Principle III – Test-First Coverage**: Plan introduces failing unit tests for keyboard mapping, timer-driven beep, and HUD sync before implementation plus ROM regression runs in CI → PASS.
- **Principle IV – Deterministic Timing & Input**: Execution loop preserves 60 Hz cadence, centralized input mapper drives keyboard layout, and pause/step controls are test-gated → PASS.
- **Principle V – Performance & Observability**: HUD pulls from existing tick data, enforces 60 fps/<50% CPU budget, and surfaces telemetry counters → PASS.
- Record mitigation steps for any exception in Complexity Tracking before proceeding (none required).

**Structure Decision**: Retain the single-project layout with emulator logic under `src/Core`, Web interface glue in `src/Platform/Web`, HUD rendering assets in `src/Rendering` and `wasm/wwwroot`, and regression tests in `tests/Unit`, `tests/Integration`, and `tests/Rom`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. Investigate optimal Chip-8 keyboard layout (`1234`/`QWER`/`ASDF`/`ZXCV`) ergonomics and confirm HUD keypad highlight mappings, noting messaging for missing keys.
2. Validate WebAudio beep approach that ties playback to the 60 Hz sound timer without adding drift; capture latency mitigation techniques.
3. Compare HUD rendering strategies (Blazor component updates vs. canvas overlay) for performance impact and memory footprint; choose preferred option.
4. Document Playwright automation strategy for asserting HUD telemetry updates and keypad highlighting in headless browsers.

**Output**: `research.md` summarizing decisions, rationale, and alternatives for keyboard layout, audio beep, HUD rendering, and test automation.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. Derive emulator snapshot structures in `data-model.md`, covering:
   - `EmulatorStateSnapshot` (registers, timers, opcode, stack depth).
   - `HudPanelDescriptor` (layout positions, update cadence, formatting rules).
   - `KeyboardLayoutProfile` (key mapping, display labels, highlight states).
   - `AudioChannelState` (mute flag, pending beep ticks).

2. Populate `/contracts/` with:
   - `input-keypad.md` specifying the canonical keyboard mapping, highlight rules, and error handling for missing keys.
   - `hud-telemetry.md` defining data points, update timing (per emulation tick), and formatting expectations.
   - `audio-beep.md` detailing when the beep must fire, mute behavior, and timing tolerances.

3. Outline regression tests:
   - Unit: keyboard mapping coverage, timer decrement pipeline, HUD sync with emulator cycle.
   - Integration: ROM run verifying HUD updates per frame, Playwright script asserting UI panels, audio beep triggered along timer countdown.

4. Author `quickstart.md` describing VS Code workflow (restore tools, `dotnet publish`, launch dev server, run Playwright tests) and manual verification steps for HUD/audio.

5. Update agent context via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` to capture dependencies (WebAudio, Playwright, HUD panels).

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*.md`, `quickstart.md`, updated agent context with enumerated failing tests ready for Phase 2 task generation.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Translate Phase 1 artifacts into tasks covering keyboard input, HUD telemetry, audio channel, and instrumentation pause/step controls.
- Each contract (`input-keypad`, `hud-telemetry`, `audio-beep`) → regression test task [P].
- Each impacted subsystem (Core CPU tick, Input mapper, Rendering HUD components, Platform Web audio bridge) → implementation task.
- Primary user story → integration/UI automation test task verifying end-to-end HUD behavior.
- Ensure TDD ordering: write/verify failing tests before implementation, telemetry validation after.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None | - | - |
